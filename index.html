			My name is Blake. I enjoy making websites and teaching others to do the same. I started writing an HTML
			tutorial series because I think everyone should have a personal website and I want to show that you don't
			have to be a computer science graduate to make one.

			series <a href="https://htmlforpeople.com/">HTML for People</a>. It's made for everyone and teaches
