        <p>After just three days, <strong>Whiskers can now create web pages</strong> better than <em>I</em> can!</p>

        <p>It all started when Whiskers, my ever-curious cat, sat on my keyboard during a coding session. Instead of shooing him away, I decided to take advantage of his interest. Little did I know, Whiskers had a knack for coding!</p>

        <p>By the end of day one, he was familiar with basic tags like <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. On day two, he was creating paragraphs and lists. By day three, he had moved on to creating stunning layouts with <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>.</p>

            "HTML is <strong>elementary</strong> my dear Watson."<br>
            <cite>&mdash; Whiskers, probably</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>He's now accepting freelance projects.</p>
