        <p>It all started with a bizarre binary message. Decoding it revealed I was hired by aliens needing a website
            for their interstellar travel agency. They had one firm request: none of our Earthly ad-tech nonsense.</p>

        <p>"Why is your web so full of garbage?" they asked. "Pop-ups, auto-playing videos, endless tracking—it's like
            navigating a minefield!" I couldn't argue. The web had become an ad-infested wasteland.</p>
	
        <p>Their site was a revelation—no ads, no pop-ups, no trackers. Just pure, unadulterated content. It felt like a
            breath of fresh air, a much needed blast of cosmic radiation.</p>

            breath of fresh air, or more accurately, a blast of cosmic radiation.</p>

        <p>Maybe one day, Earth will catch on.</p>
