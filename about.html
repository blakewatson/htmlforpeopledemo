            My name is Blake. I enjoy making websites and teaching others to do the same. I started writing an HTML
            tutorial series because I think everyone should have a personal website and I want to show that you don't
            have to be a computer science graduate to make one.

        <p>
            I'm a side project enthusiast and have put various sites, apps, and (bad) games into the world. My hobbies
            include web-related nerdery, D&D and board games, and writing. I like to participate in National Novel
            Writing Month, the annual novel-writing challenge
        </p>

        <h2>Favorite board games</h2>
