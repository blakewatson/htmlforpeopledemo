# HTML for People

I’m working on a tutorial series all about getting started making websites with HTML. It’s a beginner-level series aimed at people who may or may not have career aspirations as web developers. I don’t think websites were ever intended to be made only by "professionals." Knowing how to write HTML and put it on the internet is a skill that’s valuable to all kinds of careers and personal hobbies. HTML is for anyyone.

This repo is a demo of the site we ultimately build throughout the series.

## Where can I find it?

I'm still working on it, but it will be available at https://htmlforpeople.com/.
